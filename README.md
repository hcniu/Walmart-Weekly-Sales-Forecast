# Walmart-Weekly-Sales-Forecast
We are data scientists who are passionate about retail industry. We also notice that time series is a relatively important topic in sales prediction. Hence, we decided to take sales data from Walmart (2010~2013) as an example and created a time series model to predict 45 different Walmart storesâ€™ sales. We ended up using same parameters and machine learning methods to develop Forecast Models for each store. Thus, we have total 45 Forecasting Models for these 45 stores.

Given that most of the files are too big, I stored all the data on google drive. If you are interested, feel free to access the raw data, R files, and Python files with this link.
